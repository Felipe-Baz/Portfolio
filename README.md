# Portfolio

It consists of an amateur project, with the objective of creating a portfolio for a developer. For this project, full-stack web programming techniques were used, using the most basic technologies on the market, such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Tasks

Version and task control will be fully performed through github, as the tool was used, to modularize the project into parts, thus maintaining a good organization.

## Icons

For a better identification among the commits, emojis will be used to identify what kind of changes were applied.

- :package: new functionality;

- :up: update;

- :bug: bug fix;

- :checkered_flag: release;

## Sections of the site

It is possible to modularize the site in 6 parts, namely:

 - Header;
 
 - Knowledge;
 
 - Projects;
 
 - Contact;
 
 - Budget;
 
 - Footer;

- General functionality

### Header

The header section presents a cover of the developer's portfolio, showing both his area of expertise and his name. To complement an introduction to the developer, we have a "Saiba Mais" button that will lead to an explanation of the developer and their key technologies, however, as this is a single-page prototype, this button guides the user to the developer's github .

### Knowledge

In knowledge, the technologies that the developer is closest to and a brief presentation about them are presented.

### Projects

In projects, 3 cards were created for the 3 most relevant projects of the developer, thus giving a good presentation about the areas that he has more proximity to. A feature was applied to the cards, so that when the website's client placed the mouse over a card, some information about it would be presented, such as: project title, main technology used and a brief description of the project, such as also a "Saiba Mais" button if the site user is interested in the project.

### Contact

A contact section was created, where the user could easily send a message to the developer, without too many complications.

### Budget

![](https://i.imgur.com/S6A30LS.png)

Using JavaScript, a project budget calculator was architected, using the following rules:

- Price per page = R$ 100.00;

- If a JavaScript code is required, a 10% commission will be added;

- If it is necessary to make a design, R$ 500.00 will be added;

- An urgency rate calculation will also be applied, with a maximum time of 10 weeks, and a minimum of 1, so if the client needs a project with a deadline of 1 week, the value will be increased by 90%;

For this section, a button to send budgets to the developer was also used.

###  General functionality

Finally, a footer section was made where there are the main social networks of the developer, as well as the copyright reservation of the site.

As a general functionality of the site, a side menu was created to facilitate movement on the site, as well as access to the developer's social networks. Another feature would be the arrow located in the lower right corner of the website, which allows the website user to go back to the beginning of the website whenever necessary.

## Technologies used
 
### HTML [1]

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block on the web. Defines the meaning and structure of web content.

HTML uses "Markup" to annotate text, image, and other content for display in a web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as \< head \>,
\< title \>, \< body \>, \< header \>, \< footer \>, \< section \>, \< p \>, \< div \>, \< span \>, \< img \>, and many others.

An HTML element is separated from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name between " \< " and " \ > ". The name of an element within a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase or a mixture. For example, the \< title \> tag can be written as \< Title \>, \< TITLE \> or otherwise.

### CSS [2]

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style language (en-US) used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including various XML languages such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements are displayed on screen, on paper, in speech, or in other media.

CSS is one of the main open web languages and is standardized on web browsers according to the W3C specification. Developed in tiers, CSS1 is currently obsolete, CSS2.1 is a recommendation, and CSS3, now divided into small modules, is progressing towards standardization.

### JavaScript [3]

JavaScriptÂ® (sometimes abbreviated to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-based language with first-class functions, better known as the scripting language for web pages, but also used in many other browserless environments, such as node. js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative styles (such as functional programming). Learn more about JavaScript.

This section of the site is dedicated to the JavaScript language and not the parts that are specific to web pages and other environments. For more information on specific APIs for web pages, please refer to the Web APIs and DOM sections.

The JavaScript standard is ECMAScript. As of 2012, all modern browsers fully support ECMAScript 5.1. Older browsers support at least ECMAScript 3. On June 17, 2015, ECMA International published the sixth version of ECMAScript, which is officially called ECMAScript 2015, and was initially known as ECMAScript 6 or ES6. Since then, ECMAScript specifications are released annually. This documentation references the latest reference version, which is currently ECMAScript 2018.

JavaScript should not be confused with the Java programming language. Both Java and JavaScript are registered trademarks of Oracle in the US and other countries. However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics and usage.

### Git [4]

Git is a distributed version control system, mainly used in software development, but it can be used to record the edit history of any type of file (Example: some digital books are made available on GitHub and written little by little publicly). Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development, but has been adopted by many other projects.

Each Git working directory is a repository with a complete history and full revision tracking ability, not dependent on access to a network or a central server. Git also facilitates scientific reproducibility across a wide range of disciplines, from ecology to bioinformatics, archeology to zoology.

Git is free software, distributed under the terms of version 2 of the GNU General Public License. Its maintenance is currently supervised by Junio Hamano.
